# Python-Kahoot-Bot
A Kahoot Bot made by Zacky2613 in Python [3.7.0] with the modules tkinter (for the gui), and KahootPY (for the botting).

Currently the bots don't do anything they won't answer questions they will just kinda sit there, this bot works at schools unless the kahoot website is blocked so don't worry
