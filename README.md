# Python-Kahoot-Bot
A Kahoot Bot made by Zacky2613 in Python 3.7.0 with the modules tkinter (for the gui), and KahootPY (for the botting)

Currently the bots don't do anything they won't answer questions they will just kinda sit there, if you're a student you can use this at your school if kahoot botting websites are blocked.

for the code to work do: `pip install -U KahootPY`
