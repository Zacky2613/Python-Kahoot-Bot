# Python-Kahoot-Bot
A Kahoot Bot made by Zacky2613 in Python [3.7.0] with the modules tkinter (for the gui), and KahootPY (for the botting).

Currently the bots don't do anything they won't answer questions they will just kinda sit there, this bot works at schools unless the kahoot website is blocked so don't worry.

If you want the bots to leave close the terminal (not the GUI / goo) and wait 22 seconds and the bots will leave

# KahootPY Installation
